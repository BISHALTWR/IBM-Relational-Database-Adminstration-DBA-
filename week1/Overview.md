## Tasks:
    - Check database dashboards for activity alerts and resolve issues
    - Check overniight batch jobs
    - Review support tickets
    - Optimize queries
    - Clarify requests and schema changes
    - Work with developers, data engineers and data architects
    - Stress test scenarios
    - Determine appropriate server resources
    - Automate repeating tasks
    - Monitor database activities

- Checking state of db
- resolving issues
- responding to support tickets
- meeting with developers and other stakeholders
- monitoring db activities

## Database life cycle

4 stages:
- Requirement analysis
- Design and plan
- Implementation
- Monitoring and maintenance

### Requirement analysis
- Understand purpose and scope of the database
    - Analyze need for databse
    - Clarify goals for database
    - Identify users
- Work with stakeholders: developers, data engineers, adminstrators, end users, technology managers, other DBAs

### Design and plan
- Work with database objects
    - Instances, databases, tables and indexes
- Database model represents the design of the database: ER diagram is used

### Implementation
- Create and configure database objects
- Grant access for database users, groups
- Automate repeating tasks (backup)
- Deploy data movement (migrate, load...)

### Monitor and maintain
- Monitor for performance issues
- Review reports
- Apply upgrades and patches to RDBMSes
- Automate deployements and routine tasks
- Troubleshoot issues
- Security and compliancec
    - authorization, failure management(from logs), maintain permission

## Summary:
- The db life cycle stages are requirements analysis, design and plan, implementation, and monitor and maintain
- In the requrirements analysis stage, DBSa determine the purpose and scope of the database
- In the design and plan stage, DBAs work on logical and physical design
- In the implementation stage, DBAs deploy the database
- In the monitor and maintain stage, DBAs manage the daily operations of the database

# Data Security, Ethical and Compliance Considerations

## Fundamental Ethics:
- Transparency: When you collect information, let the owners of information know along with usage
- Consent: You should get clear consent
- Integrity: Be clear about procedures and policies and always follow them consistency

## Secure System design:
- Protection from malicious access
- Secure storage
- Accurate access: i.e. Previleg
- Secure movement
- Secure archiving

## Compliance Issues
- National/International Regulations
- Industry standards
- Organization best
